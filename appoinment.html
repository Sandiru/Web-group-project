        <p>At The Mechanic we are always willing to do a thorough assessment of your vehicle. In fact, we love the chance to provide customers with estimates because it allows us to show them how much money we can save them! For an honest, up-front auto repair estimate, trust The Mechanic.</p>

        <h4>ELIMINATE THE GUESSWORK WITH CAR REPAIR ESTIMATES</h4>
        <P class="p-3">No one likes to agree to a repair on something as essential as a vehicle without knowing what’s coming. At The Garage Inc we want you to feel absolutely comfortable and confident leaving your car with us. That’s why we hope you’ll stop in for an auto repair estimate
             whenever you’re concerned about your vehicle’s <span class="text-danger">maintenance or repair needs.</span></P>

     <div class="third">
        <h4>TALKING TO AN AUTOMOTIVE PROFESSIONAL ABOUT YOUR AUTO REPAIR ESTIMATE</h4>
        <p class="p-3">We want to talk to you about your vehicle, and we definitely want to listen to what you have to say. After all, you’re the expert when it comes to what seems wrong with your car. When you come in for your auto repair estimate, be sure to tell us about anything you have observed—seen, heard, or felt—that is different. It’s okay if you’re not sure what’s wrong;
             just tell us what doesn’t seem right.</p>
             <br>

        <p class="p-3">If you get a chance, jot down some notes before you come in. What is your car doing (or not doing)? How is it handling? Are there any new noises you’ve been hearing? How is your vehicle’s performance—is it braking well and speeding up like it should? 
            How do road conditions, weather conditions, and other factors affect your car? Have you done any recent maintenance? Have you missed any routine maintenance? You can expect a thorough inspection from us, and the more information you have for us, the better.
             In fact, you can save diagnostic time pretty effectively by giving us all of the details!</p>
     </div>

     <div class="final">
        <h4>AUTO REPAIR ESTIMATES THAT YOU CAN TRUST</h4>
        <p class="p-3">Many consumers worry about bringing their vehicle in for repair. Will the mechanic listen to me? Will I be able to explain what’s going on in a way that makes sense?
             Will my vehicle get the full attention of the technician? Will they spend the time they should?</p>
             <br>
        <p>The good news is this: we are even more worried about this problem than you are! Lack of confidence in our profession as a whole hurts our business and our family team of professionals. You can trust the auto repair estimate you get from us.
             We stake our reputations on our conduct each day! We are here to give you a square deal on car repair estimates.</p>
